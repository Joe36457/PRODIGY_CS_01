If you look at the encrypted text carefully, you will find out that modern analysts using strong numerical methods will not have difficulties in decrypting Caesar cipher. Despite its disadvantages, more sophisticated encryption methods are built on principles of Caesar cipher. This makes it an essential tool to comprehend the evolution of cryptography. Moreover, if you compare this encryption scheme to others used in World War II for example German Enigma or Japanese Purple encoding system, it appears to be primitive and weak.

In the example code snippet attached below we can see a case where the shift value is 1. In the example the message is "Hi Joseph this is a secret message" and with a shift value of 1 the message masks itself by shifting one letter from each alphabet in the message defined, I takes the place of H and J takes the place of I and so on. While decrypting the encrypted message i.e. "Ij Kptfqi uijt jt b tfdsfu nfttbhf" with the shift value of 1 the result from the decrypted message section provides us with the actual message.
